- **OLSNEW.R** ‚Äì Runs the OLS regressions reported in Section 7 of the paper  
- **LogRegNEW.R** ‚Äì Runs the logistic regressions reported in Section 8 of the paper  
- **CSES_cluster.R** ‚Äì Replication file for Subsection 6.2  
- **CSESSocioDem.R** ‚Äì Replication file for Section 8  
- **DATA/** ‚Äì Directory containing all raw datasets required to run the replication files (freely accessible)

## Software environment

- Tested on **TuxedoOS (Debian/Ubuntu)** with  
  **R version 4.3.3 (2024-02-29) ‚Äî "Angel Food Cake"**

### Required R packages

```r
library(dplyr)
library(cluster)
library(factoextra)
library(ggplot2)
library(ineq)
library(dineq)
library(rstatix)
library(tidyr)
library(IC2)        # install via remotes::install_version("IC2")
library(parallel)
library(modelsummary)
library(rlang)
```

---

## Reproduction instructions

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salvabarbaro/Dichotomous.git
   ```

2. **Open R (‚â• 4.3.3)**  
   We recommend Linux (tested on TuxedoOS), as some functions rely on OS-specific parallelisation.

3. **Install the required packages**  
   See list above. For `IC2` (no longer maintained), install via:
   ```r
   remotes::install_version("IC2")
   ```

4. **Ensure the `DATA/` folder is present**  
   All replication files depend on the raw datasets in this directory.

5. **Run the replication scripts** according to the section of the paper:
   - `RF_France22.R`, `RF_Graz.R`, `RF_Grenoble.R` ‚Äì dataset analyses  
   - `OLSNEW.R` ‚Äì OLS regressions (Section 7)  
   - `LogRegNEW.R` ‚Äì Logistic regressions (Section 8)  
   - `CSES_cluster.R` ‚Äì Subsection 6.2  
   - `CSESSocioDem.R` ‚Äì Section 8

## Data sources

- Grenoble data: [Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3548303](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3548303)  
- Graz data: provided by Andreas Klamler (see Darmann and Klamler 2023, *Public Choice*)  
- France22 data: [Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10568798](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10568798)  
- CSES data: freely available at [cses.org](https://cses.org) (not included in `DATA/`)

## Notes and warnings

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Parallelisation**  
  Some replication files use `mclapply()`, which only works on Linux/Unix.  
  On Windows/macOS, replace with `lapply()` or adapt the code.

- üïí **Computation time**  
  Running all replication scripts takes about **1.5 hours** on a standard workstation.

- üìÇ **Auxiliary functions**  
  `AuxFunctions.RData` is required by the replication scripts.  
  If missing, regenerate by running `AuxFunctions.R`.
